Project Title: House Price Predictor

Problem Statement: The housing market is an important and complex sector that impacts people's lives in many ways. For many individuals and families, buying a house is one of the biggest investments they will make in their lifetime. Therefore, it is essential to accurately predict the prices of houses so that buyers and sellers can make informed decisions. This project aims to use machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other relevant factors.


Project Steps

 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking

Problem Definition: The problem is to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. The objective is to develop a model that accurately predicts the prices of houses based on a set of features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other relevant factors. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.

Design Thinking:

Data Source: Choose a dataset containing information about houses, including features like location, square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and price.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and convert categorical features into numerical representations.
Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features for predicting house prices.
Model Selection: Choose a suitable regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor) for predicting house prices.
Model Training: Train the selected model using the preprocessed data.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
 2: Innovation

Consider exploring advanced regression techniques like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost for improved prediction accuracy.
